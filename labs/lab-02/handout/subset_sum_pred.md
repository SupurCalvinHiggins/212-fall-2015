# Predictions

TODO: Predict the largest input size your program can solve in under one second.

# Benchmarks

TODO: Find the largest input size your program can solve in under one
second.

# Analysis

TODO: Decide whether your `subset_sum` function is fast enough or too slow. If you are familiar with $\mathcal{O}$
-notation, provide an asymptotic bound on your algorithm's time complexity.

# Revised Algorithm

TODO: Explain your new algorithm.
