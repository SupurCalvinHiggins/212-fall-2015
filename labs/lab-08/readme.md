# Lab 8 - Binary Search Trees

# Overview

In this lab, you will design, implement and analyze binary search trees.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

1. Implement abstract data types with binary search trees.
2. Evaluate the performance characteristics of binary search trees.

TODO.

## Grading

To receive full credit, you should:

1. Attend, participate and collaborate.
2. Make at least one submission to Gradescope.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effort is enough to receive full credit. You do not need to successfully complete any activities.

## Milestones

To achieve the lab objectives, you should:

1. Complete all activities listed under **Core Content**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not complete all activities listed under **Core Content** during the lab period, we recommend finishing them
> on your own. Subsequent labs, assignments and lectures will assume you have completed this lab's **Core Content**
> activities.

To leave early, you should:

1. Complete all activities listed under **Core Content**.
2. Complete all activities listed under **Extra Practice** or **Optional Advanced Topics**.

To maximize your learning, you should:

1. Complete all activities listed under **Core Content**.

3. Attempt some activities listed under **Optional Advanced Topics**.

# Core Content

## Project Setup

1. Create a new project called `csc212-lab-08` in your IDE.
2. Download all files from [the lab handout folder](handout) into the `csc212-lab-08` project.

> [!NOTE]
> To download all files from the repository, navigate to the root of the repository, click on the green **Code** button
> and select **Download Zip**.`

## Set

TODO

### Implementation

In this section, you will design and implement a set using a binary search tree.

1. Complete `set.h` and `set.cpp`.
2. Build `test_set` from `set.cpp`, and `test_set.cpp`.
3. Run `test_set`. All tests should pass.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Submit `set.h` and `set.cpp` to Gradescope.

### Theoretical Analysis

In this section, you will analyze the time complexity of your set implementation. If you spend more than 5-10 minutes on
this section, look at the solution provided below and move on.

## Map

TODO

### Implementation

In this section, you will design and implement a map using a binary search tree.

1. Complete `map.h` and `map.cpp`.
2. Build `test_map` from `map.cpp`, and `test_map.cpp`.
3. Run `test_map`. All tests should pass.
