one lecture;
    definitions: path, path length, depth (node, tree), height (node, tree)
    k-ary, perfect, complete, full
    6 problems:
        3x: height of tree, depth of tree, perfect, complete, full, arity
            complete 4-ary, height 1
            full 3-ary, height 2
            perfect 2-ary, height 2
        max/min height of perfect tree k-ary on n nodes
        max/min height of complete tree k-ary on n nodes
        max/min height of full tree k-ary on n nodes

one lecture:
    binary search trees

    contains, insert, remove
    traversals: pre, post, inorder, level order
    6 problems:
        2x all traversals after insert
        2x all traversals after remove (hit all three cases)
            no children, one child, two children
        which is a worst-case insert sequence? what is complexity?
        which is a best-case insert sequence? what is complexity?
