# Overview

In this assignment, you will practice TODO.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

1. Trace how common dynamic array and min/max-heaps operations change the data structure's internal state.
2. Trace the execution of programs that use stacks, queues and min/max-priority queues.
3. Analyze the asymptotic time complexity of common dynamic array and min/max-heap operations.
4. Analyze the asymptotic time complexity of programs that use stacks, queues, and min/max-priority queues.
5. Select between stacks, queues, or min/max-priority queues to efficiently solve computational problems.

Analysis of building min-heap via inserting increasing (or mostly increasing) sequence.
Analysis of queue where the first n integers are inserted in order, cycled to front where only the integers that are 0 under mod k are retained.
Analysis of heapsort with many duplicate elements.

Analysis of d-ary heap with parameter optimization on d. Consider the case where each node is implemented with a heap.

## Grading

This assignment is graded out of $$100$$ points. However, we provide $$200$$ points' worth of problems:

1. Only your first $$100$$ points count towards your grade.
2. The extra problems give you flexibility to:
    * Choose problems that best support your learning
    * Earn more than $$100$$ points in case of mistakes (your grade will be capped at $$100$$).
    * Practice additional problems in preparation for the midterm.

**You are not expected to complete every problem!**

## Milestones

Problems are labeled as **Core Content**, **Extra Practice** or **Optional Advanced Topics**.

To prepare for the midterm, you should:

1. Complete at least one of each **Core Content** problem type

## Recommendations

The midterm will include many free response questions. To prepare effectively:

* Avoid relying on multiple choice options to guide your answer. Instead, work out your solution first, then check
  against the choices.
* Use any resources available (including AI), but always attempt each problem on your own for 5-10 minutes before
  seeking help.

## Confirmation

I have read and understand the above.
